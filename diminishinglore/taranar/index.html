    <h1>Taranar</h1>

    <img src="/images/taranarSoldier.png" alt="Kingdom of Taranar" class="lore-image">

    <p>
        Taranar  is renowned for some of the best warriors in the world. They achieve this with great control of lightning magic. It allows them to be faster than an average man and can pierce through enemy lines swiftly. With this ability it allows them to dodge blows from a sword, or even an arrow. Their top warriors are even more formidable taking their mastery over lightning magic to the max. They can descend from the skies like a bolt of lightning, and can be just as devastating. Needless to say, they are a tremendous foe, however very few of the Taranar can attain this level of skill. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Even then, there is a drawback of that powerful force. Using their lightning magic to enhance their physical skills puts a very large strain on the user's body. After exerting so much energy and mana, the user can be extremely fatigued and may need to recover for days. This also has long term effects as well. Usually the more powerful and skilled a warrior is, the shorter they can be a worthwhile soldier, as it taxes the body so much. It is because of this that they are not a very aggressive faction, but more passive and defensive. They do not want to needlessly over tax their soldiers. A war for Taranar can retire a lot of soldiers just from the strain on their body, and not even because of a loss of life. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Another aspect of this is that when a war is waged, they tend to stay as one large host. One advantage of this is that they can move everything that they need quickly from one place to another so it makes logistics easier. It also allows soldiers to have a fighting rotation allowing previous combatants to recover. They can better rotate soldiers in and out of combat allowing them to recover from battle. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Taranar is led by one individual who both controls the military and governs. This individual is known as the Grand Seeker. A new Grand Seeker is only chosen after the current one passes away or retires. When this happens, anyone can attempt to be the next Grand Seeker in The Seeker Trials. When attempting to become the Grand Seeker, they challenge their god, Zoras. Zoras then chooses from the candidates one that is worthy to lead the people. If no one is found, then the people are leaderless until one worthy is declared. Governance is left up to the advisors, while a Seeker is chosen to act as temporary military leader.
    </p>
    <p>
        The god Zoras is one of the most powerful gods in the world. He is unmatched with his power of lightning. With his lightning magic, he is the fastest creature on the planet. He also is heavily armored, which provides him protection and extra heft with his attacks. With his heavier frame and fast speed, he can decimate most everything. The only drawback is the considerable man required to move that fast and exert so much power. For this reason, he rarely leaves the Thunder Peaks, as the constant thunderstorm supplies him with the power he needs. His one goal for the Taranar Kingdom is to acquire knowledge about the Ancient Ones in hopes of being able to restore an old friend. To this end, Taranar is one of the most knowledgeable places regarding the Ancient Ones, and they work very heavily with Altburg which some there also have an interest in the Ancient Ones.

    </p>
    <p>
        Taranar  has spiked mountains along the coast, then savanna grasslands at the bases of the mountains. They use these fields to grow plenty of wheat and other food. Also in the mountains, there is a special ore called  lightning ore. Overall, this ore is not very strong or useful, except for the unique property of becoming energized and strong with electricity and magic in general. It is also light weight which makes it perfect weapons and armor for their soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
        They trade food with other cities which is how they make most of their money. They will also sell their ore as well for special projects. They also tend to send out many mercenaries. This is another way the make money, but also gain more information about the Ancient Ones. From the mercenary the build relationships and end up with contract from people with a lot of power and wealth.
