    <h1>The Kingdom of Shaladar </h1>
    <p>
        Along the Coast of Dalris Lake, is the City of Altras. Altras is the capital of Shaladar and is The heart and might of the kingdom. The kingdom is formed by multiple dukedoms that serve the King. These dukedoms form a large area of land, and have different cultures and backgrounds.
    </p>
    <p>
        Altras is well known for one of the greatest Mage’s guilds in the world. This city has trained thousands of mages that travel across the world enriching the lives of others, and enriching the college as well. The Mages college is a vast repository of the study of various different magic types like water, fire, wind, time, etc. Some magics are forbidden such as necromancy and chaos magics. They train their younger and less experienced mages in practical magics to help out the kingdom, but some of the higher end mages practice the more theoretical and possible uses of magic. They also have devised what they call The Magic Ark.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Ark is a reservoir of magic that the mages channel The Winds of Magic into it, and with the help of massive magical crystals, store large amounts of mana. These individuals are called Arkohns. The mages that also graduate from the college are given a stone that allows them to communicate with the mages that are currently controlling Ark’s power. With this magical stone, a mage can communicate and ask for mana if there is not enough in the region, or if they need a large amount very quickly. This is normally reserved for very important circumstances, and can be used for war or other dire situations. 
    </p>
    <p>
        While the college is not necessarily known for their battle mages, they certainly do study war magic as well. Some mages will dedicate themselves to war magic and can be formidable opponents in their own right. The highest ranks of mages for the army are even trained on how to ride a Griffon. This is considered an honor, as full grown griffons are harder to come by since they are rarer. This allows the mages to be very mobile, and can defend themselves easier from enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
        The griffons are one of the biggest strengths to their army and truly make up their elite units. If not used for mages, then griffons will be part of the Griffon Legion. This is a group of elite cavalry and can decimate unprepared flanks.
    </p>
    <p>
        If that wasn’t enough, Shaladar is also the largest and richest human kingdom. With their dominant trade capacity with many parts of the world, they have quite a few different races that reside in their city such as the Al’Rahm, Dwarfs, and Elves. Besides Altburg, Shaladar is one of the most diverse places in the world.  But being the biggest human kingdom, they are able  to field larger armies than most foes, and can spare the expense to have some well trained soldiers as well. This makes them a very versatile and capable country.
    </p>
    <p>
        With Altras being right next to Dalris Lake, it also has access to many different cities across Alara allowing it to also be a dominant trade hub. One of the rivers connects all the way to the Free city of Altburg which is an ocean city in the west. Atlburg does not have a large enough region to fully defend themselves, so the Shaladar kingdom provides them with protection in exchange for good trade routes out of the port city. 
    </p>
    <p>
        They also have peace treaties with almost all neighboring nations, even the Zhrahli empire. So there are few borders that they are concerned about, and they can place armies there as a deterrence for any possible nations that may wish to wage war.
